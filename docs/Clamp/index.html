        <h2>Clamp is a function that ensures that a value is inside some limits.</h2>

        <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
        <br>

        Imagine a variable which value can be anything. You would like to confine it to a range from 0 to 50. If the value goes below 0, it will remain as 0.
        If it goes over 50, it will remain as 50.
        <br><br>
        Clamp does this exact thing.<br><br>
        The function has 3 parameters; value, min, max, in that order. Value is the value that you want to confine, min is the minimum value and max
        is the maximum value.<br><br>

        For the example mentioned above, it would be:<br>

        <pre class="prettyprint">let outputValue = Clamp(value, 0, 50);</pre>

        If the input value is 25, the output would still be 25.
